Created a simple site with html and git. The site has two recipes - plum streusel muffins and grilled cheese sandwiches. The muffin recipe came from: https://www.allrecipes.com/plum-streusel-muffins-recipe-8698288 and the grilled cheese from: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23891/grilled-cheese-sandwich/.
